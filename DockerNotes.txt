Docker: Docker is a container management tool. we can use it to build and manage containers.
Docker is very popular, because of how easy it is to use as well as it's central repository
of pre-built images that we can use locally (i.e. DockerHub)

Containers and Virtual Machines.

Virtual Machines are useful, because we virtualize the hardware. This makes it easier to manage
large clusters and networks of compute instance because we don't need to buy brand new
hardware everytime we need a new computer instance.


With containers, the virtualization happens at the Operating System level. This is why we need a
linux kernel or subsystem to run linux containers. Containers are much more lightweight than
VM/s because we don't need to keep a copy of the OS libraries.


How do we build our own Containers?

Define a Dockerfile --> Build an image --> Run a Container

My goal is to create an image that can be used to run my app

Example1: We build the jar file and copy over the jar to our image
